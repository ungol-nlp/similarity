import timeit


# Use the min() rather than the average of the timings. That is a
# recommendation from me, from Tim Peters, and from Guido van
# Rossum. The fastest time represents the best an algorithm can
# perform when the caches are loaded and the system isn't busy with
# other tasks. All the timings are noisy -- the fastest time is the
# least noisy. It is easy to show that the fastest timings are the
# most reproducible and therefore the most useful when timing two
# different implementations. â€“ Raymond Hettinger Apr 3 '12
